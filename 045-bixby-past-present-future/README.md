# LP and MILP Optimization with Dr. Robert Bixby


I recently watched Dr. Robert Bixby's compelling presentation, "Optimization: Past, Present, Future," which reshaped my perspective on the operations research discipline I work in daily.

Dr. Bixby, the co-founder of the companies Gurobi Optimization and CPLEX, traced the remarkable journey of mathematical optimization from its theoretical origins to its current status as an indispensable business tool. Starting with George Dantzig's simplex method in 1947, optimization remained an academic curiosity with limited practical application for decades. The transformation began in the late 1980s and accelerated dramatically during the 1990s. 



## What was the breakthrough?  

A convergence of theoretical advances, computational power, and software engineering brilliance. The release of CPLEX 6.5 in 1998 delivered performance improvements of over 10 times by implementing decades of research that had been sitting dormant in academic journals.

What strikes me most is how relevant these 70-year-old technologies remain today. Linear and mixed-integer programming power critical decisions across industries, from semiconductor manufacturing facilities with $4 billion-plus operations to supply chain optimization at global corporations. Looking ahead, Dr. Bixby identifies an exciting turning point: the explosion of available business data, coupled with a growing corporate focus on analytics, positions optimization to play an even more central role in enterprise decision-making. 

Organizations that master optimization will gain unprecedented competitive advantages as data quality improves and advanced analytics mature. The future isn't just about faster solvers; it's about transforming how businesses operate at every level.
