# How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor

For those who have ever pondered the intricacies of operating a **nuclear power plant**, extending beyond the confines of policy debates and accident case studies, Colin Tucker's How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor offers a captivating and enlightening exploration.

This text is not a conventional nuclear energy textbook. Tucker employs a pragmatic approach, situating readers within the role of a trainee reactor operator at a **pressurized water reactor** (PWR), the most prevalent type of reactor on a global scale. The expert will provide a comprehensive overview of the reactor lifecycle, encompassing the entire spectrum from initiation to deactivation. The instructor will elucidate the scientific and engineering principles that underpin the process, as well as the methods by which operators ensure safety.

Tucker's approach merits particular attention, as he adeptly balanced depth and clarity in his analysis. The terminology employed in the field of **nuclear engineering** has been noted for its potential to be opaque and daunting to the uninitiated. This complexity arises, in part, from the prevalence of multiple names given to the same components. The author endeavors to employ consistent terminology and methodically guides readers through complex subjects without oversimplifying them.

💡 This book is an essential resource for energy sector professionals, engineering students, and those interested in the global infrastructure that enables societal functioning. This text serves to address a significant lacuna in the extant literature on nuclear energy by offering operational insights in a narrative-driven, human-centered manner.
