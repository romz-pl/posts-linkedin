# Branch-and-Price Free Access Book


After years of development in operations research, we finally have a comprehensive resource that unifies decades of knowledge: the newly published **"Branch-and-Price" by Desrosiers, Lubbecke, Desaulniers, and Gauthier**.

For those working with structured integer programming problems — think logistics, transportation, healthcare scheduling, or production planning — this 657-page volume represents a paradigm shift in how we approach decomposition methods.


## The Core Algorithm
Branch-and-Price elegantly combines column generation with branch-and-bound search trees. Its power lies in decomposing complex problems into manageable building blocks, then solving these components through specialized algorithms. This approach has become the standard for integer programs with independent substructures linked by spatial, temporal, or resource constraints.


## What Makes This Book Essential
The authors progress systematically through the algorithmic foundations. Starting with column generation for large-scale linear programs, they introduce the **Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition** — a reformulation technique based on convexification of sub-domains. They extend this framework to integer programs through discretization approaches, then demonstrate practical applications in vehicle routing and crew scheduling.

The book doesn't stop at primal methods. A dedicated chapter explores the dual perspective, connecting Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation with Lagrangian relaxation and introducing stabilization techniques that enhance algorithmic performance. The Branch-Price-and-Cut chapter synthesizes everything, showing how branching and cutting decisions lead to optimal integer solutions.


## Why It Matters
This consolidates knowledge from hundreds of published applications across industries — from energy and politics to sports and education. The authors, drawing from decades with Montréal's GENCOL group, share not just theory but also practical experience acquired during the development of the GCG software. Each chapter includes exercises with solutions, often extending the theoretical framework.

💡 Whether you're optimizing supply chains, designing schedules, or tackling resource allocation problems, this book provides the algorithmic toolkit you need. It's a testament to how mathematical rigor meets real-world impact.
