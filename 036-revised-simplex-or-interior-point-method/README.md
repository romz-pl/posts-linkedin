# Revised Simplex or Interior Point Method?

I recently came across **"Linear and Convex Optimization" by Michael H. Veatch**, and it addresses a gap I've long observed in operations research education.

Most introductory operations research textbooks fall into two categories. Some emphasize models and algorithms without rigorous justification, while others delve so deeply into mathematical theory that they overlook practical applications. Veatch's book strikes a valuable balance, making it particularly useful for mathematics students entering the field of optimization.


## Three critical dimensions

First, it **showcases modeling** through diverse real-world applications in online marketing, humanitarian response, healthcare delivery, finance, and transportation. These are not trivial problems, but rather examples of successful operations research implementations.

Second, the book maintains **mathematical rigor** without becoming inaccessible. It uses matrix notation extensively and doesn't gloss over questions of correctness while remaining at an undergraduate level. This approach honors students' mathematical maturity while developing their operations research toolkit.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, it teaches **algorithmic thinking** instead of assuming it. Rather than presenting algorithms as arbitrary procedures, it explains why they are designed the way they are and what makes them efficient.


## Convex optimization

While many texts at this level omit convex programming, Veatch includes it. This is a forward-looking choice, given the surge in convex optimization applications over the past three decades. Conceptually, convex programming pairs well with linear programming, and both can efficiently solve large-scale applied problems.

💡 This book is valuable for mathematically trained instructors who are not operations research specialists, as well as for students curious about the practical applications of their mathematical knowledge. It demonstrates that optimization is not only theoretically elegant but also useful for solving significant real-world problems.
