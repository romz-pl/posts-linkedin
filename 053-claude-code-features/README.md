# Claude Code for C++ Development

After using the C++ programming language for a long time and dealing with problems like memory leaks, working with legacy code code, and fixing issues of undefined behavior, it's clear that Claude Code has had a big impact on my daily work.

I use it every single day. And the difference is hard to overstate.

## Upgrading legacy C++ code is where Claude Code truly shines. 

If you've tried to move a large group of code from C++11 to C++17 or C++20, you know how hard it is. You'll encounter things like old structures that are no longer in use, different methods, and having to manually edit a lot of code files. Claude Code really understands modern C++ idioms. It identifies opportunities to replace raw pointers with smart pointers, refactor verbose lambda expressions, apply std::optional where appropriate, and leverage structured bindings; all while respecting the intent of the original code. What used to take days of careful, error-prone refactoring now takes a fraction of the time.


## Bug fixing is where it becomes genuinely indispensable.

C++ bugs are very hard to find. These issues can hide for weeks because of race conditions, dangling references, and subtle undefined behavior. Claude Code doesn't just point at a line and say it's all there is to it. It explains the logic, reasons about ownership semantics, and why something is broken, not just what is broken. This difference is very important when you're dealing with a complicated system.

I use it for many things, like writing unit tests with Google Test, generating CMake configurations, reviewing API designs, and writing technical documents that accurately describe the code.

## The productivity gains are real, but the deeper value is mental.

I can focus on solving the right problems because I have a collaborator who always understands C++ at a high level. This means I don't have to stop and think about what I'm doing because I don't have to switch contexts.

If you're a C++ developer and you haven't used Claude Code yet, I encourage you to try it. It's easy to learn how to use it. The upside is significant.
